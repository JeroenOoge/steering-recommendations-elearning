These files were part of a custom Drupal module called Wiski.

*wiski.rules.inc* contains the code for custom Rules (see https://www.drupal.org/project/rules/releases/7.x-2.13)
which fire upon correct/wrong answering and then adapt the Elo rating for the involved user and exercise.

*wiski.module* contains code for generating exercise series and detecting wrong answers. The latter was used together
with the Quiz module (see https://www.drupal.org/project/quiz/releases/7.x-5.8).
